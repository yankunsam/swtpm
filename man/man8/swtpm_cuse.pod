=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<swtpm_cuse [OPTIONS]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<swtpm_cuse> implements a TPM software emulator built on libtpms.
It provides access to TPM functionality over a Linux CUSE
(character device in user space) interface.

The B<swtpm_ioctl> command should be used for a graceful shutdown
of the CUSE TPM.

The following options are supported:

=over 4

=item B<-h | --help>

Display help screen.

=item B<--tpmstate dir=E<lt>dirE<gt>>

This parameter allows to set the directory where the TPM will
store its persistent state to. If this parameter is not set,
the environment variable I<TPM_PATH> can be set instead.

=item B<-n E<lt>device nameE<gt> | --name=E<lt>device nameE<gt> (mandatory)>

The name of the character device to create. To create /dev/vtpm-200, the
given device name must be vtpm-200. The character device will be created
automatically and use unused major and minor numbers unless they
are explicitly requested through options.

=item B<-M E<lt>majorE<gt> | --maj=E<lt>majorE<gt>>

The device major number to use; can be omitted.

=item B<-m E<lt>minorE<gt> | --min=E<lt>minorE<gt>>

The device minor number to use; can be omitted.

=item B<-r E<lt>userE<gt> | --runas=E<lt>userE<gt>>

The user to switch to and drop privileges.

=item B<--log fd=E<lt>fdE<gt>|file=E<lt>pathE<gt>[,level=E<lt>nE<gt>]>[,prefix=E<lt>prefixE<gt>]

Enable logging to a file given its file descriptor or its path. Use '-' for path to
suppress the logging.

The level parameter allows to choose the level of logging. Starting at log
level 5, libtpms debug logging is activated.

All logged lines will be prefixed with prefix. By default no prefix is prepended.

=item B<--key file=E<lt>keyfileE<gt>[,format=E<lt>hex|binaryE<gt>][,mode=aes-cbc],[remove[=true|false]]>

Enable encryption of the state files of the TPM. The keyfile must contain
an AES key of supported size; currently only 128 bit (16 bytes) keys are
supported.

The key may be in binary format, in which case the file size must be 16 bytes.
If the key is in hex format (default), the key may consist of 32 hex digits
starting with an optional '0x'.

The I<mode> parameter indicates which block chaining mode is to be used.
Currently only aes-cbc is supported.

The I<remove> parameter will attempt to remove the given keyfile once the key
has been read.

=item B<--key pwdfile=E<lt>passphrase fileE<gt>[,mode=aes-cbc],[remove[=true|false]]>

This variant of the key parameter allows to provide a passphrase in a file.
A maximum of 32 bytes are read from the file and a key is derived from it using a
SHA512 hash. Currently only 128 bit keys are supported.

=item B<--migration-key file=E<lt>keyfileE<gt>[,format=E<lt>hex|binaryE<gt>][,mode=aes-cbc],[remove[=true|false]]>

The availability of a migration key ensures that the state of the TPM
will not be revealed in unencrypted form by the swtpm_cuse program when
the TPM state blobs are retreived through the ioctl interface.
The migration key is not used for encrypting TPM state written to files,
this is what the <I>--key<I> parameter is used for.

The migration key and the key used for encrypting the TPM state files may be the same.

While the key for the TPM state files needs to stay with those files it encrypts, the
migration key needs to stay with the TPM state blobs. If for example the state of the
TPM is migrated between hosts in a data center, then the TPM migration key must be
available at all the destinations, so in effect it may have to be a key shared across
all machines in the datacenter. In contrast to that, the key used for encrypting the
TPM state <B>files<B> can be different for each TPM and need only be available
on the host where the TPM state resides.

The migration key enables the encryption of the TPM state blobs of the TPM.
The keyfile must contain an AES key of supported size; currently only 128 bit (16 bytes)
keys are supported.

The key may be in binary format, in which case the file size must be 16 bytes.
If the key is in hex format (default), the key may consist of 32 hex digits
starting with an optional '0x'.

The I<mode> parameter indicates which block chaining mode is to be used.
Currently only aes-cbc is supported.

The I<remove> parameter will attempt to remove the given keyfile once the key
has been read.

=item B<--migration-key pwdfile=E<lt>passphrase fileE<gt>[,mode=aes-cbc],[remove[=true|false]]>

This variant of the migration key parameter allows to provide a passphrase in a file.
A maximum of 32 bytes are read from the file and a key is derived from it using a
SHA512 hash. Currently only 128 bit keys are supported.

=item B<--pid file=E<lt>pidfileE<gt>>

This options allows to set the name of file where the process ID (pid) of the CUSE TPM
will be written into. The file will be written by the root user.
